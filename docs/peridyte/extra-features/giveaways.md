## 🤖 Commands

Start a giveaway with the command:  
`/giveaway {prize} {duration}`  
Replace `{prize}` with what users can win (e.g. "Nitro") and `{duration}` with how long the giveaway should last (e.g. "1h", "2d", "30m").

## 🕒 Duration Format

You can use the following formats for the duration:

- `m` = minutes (e.g. `30m`)
- `h` = hours (e.g. `2h`)
- `d` = days (e.g. `1d`)
