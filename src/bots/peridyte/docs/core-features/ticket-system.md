# Ticket System

---

## ⚙️ Setup

To set up the ticket feature, first create a **ticket channel** and use the `/ticketpanel` command in it.  
This will send a simple ticket panel in the current channel.

Once that’s done, you can define which roles should have access to tickets using:  
`/ticketrole {action} {role}`  
Replace `{action}` and `{role}` with the actual values.
- `{action}` can be: `add`, `remove`, or `list`.
