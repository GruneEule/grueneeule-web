## ⚙️ Setup

Use the command:  
`/joinrole {role}`  
Replace `{role}` with the role that should automatically be assigned to new users when they join the server.

## 📜 Info

If you are using the [Verification System](/core-features/verification.md) to assign the "Member" role,  
you **cannot use the same role** here as a join role — to avoid conflicts.
